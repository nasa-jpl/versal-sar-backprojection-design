AI Engines (AIEs) are an array of very-long instruction word (VLIW) processors 
with single instruction multiple data (SIMD) vector units that are highly
optimized for compute-intensive applications \cite{AMD_Versal_UG1079}. The AIE
array supportes three levels of parallelism:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP):} Through the VLIW 
        architecture allowing multiple operations to be executed in a single 
        clock cycle.
    \item \textbf{SIMD:} Through vector registers allowing multiple elements
        (for example, eight) to be computed in parallel.
    \item \textbf{Multicore:} Through the AIE array, allowing up to 400 AIE
        tiles to execute in parallel.
\end{itemize}

While most standard C code can be compiled for the AI Engine, the code might
need restructuring to take full advantage of the parallelism provided by the
hardware. The power of an AI Engine is in its ability to execute a 
multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation using two vectors, load two vectors for
the next operation, store a vector from the previous operation, and increment
a pointer or execute another scalar operation in each clock cycle.
