SAR backprojection involves a series of computationally intensive steps that
present significant challenges for real-time implementation:


\begin{itemize}
\item
\textbf{Computational Intensity:}  Backprojection requires numerous
complex multiplications and phase shift calculations for each pixel-pulse
pair. This translates to a massive FLOPS requirement (quantify with
specific numbers if possible).

\item
\textbf{Data Flow and Memory Management:} SAR systems generate enormous
data volumes. Efficiently moving this data through the processing pipeline
and managing memory bandwidth becomes crucial for achieving acceptable
performance.
\end{itemize}
