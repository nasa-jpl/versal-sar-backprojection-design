Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a high-resolution imaging technique that
exploits the motion of a radar antenna over a target region to synthesize a
large effective aperture~\cite{Jansing_SAR_Concepts}. By transmitting pulses
and recording the backscattered echoes at multiple positions along its path,
SAR systems collect data that can be processed into detailed scene images. The
key advantage of SAR is its ability to achieve fine resolution in both range
and cross-range, making it essential for remote sensing tasks such as Earth
observation, surveillance, and environmental monitoring.

Among various SAR image formation methods, backprojection is a conceptually
straightforward yet computationally intensive approach. It coherently sums the
radar returns for each image pixel, applying appropriate time shifts (or phase
corrections) to align signal energy across the collected pulses. This
effectively recreates the reflected energy distribution, yielding high-quality
images resilient to motion errors, off-nominal geometries, and wide-band
signals. However, backprojection has a computational load proportional to the
product of the number of pulses and the number of pixels, which can be
expensive to implement at scale.

This work presents the design and implementation of a SAR backprojection
pipeline on the Versal ACAP (Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform) from AMD.
The Versal ACAP is a heterogeneous compute environment featuring Scalar Engines
(CPUs), Adaptable Engines (FPGA/programmable logic), and Intelligent Engines
(AI and DSP cores), which allow developers to accelerate compute-heavy tasks
\cite{AMD_Versal_WP505}.
