Placeholder for future work.

%- More AIE kernels for processing:
%    - Pixel target generation inside AIE kernels
%    - Pixel target generation from PL to AIE
%    - Have the STS kernel take the pixels from the host and round robin them to
%    the AIE
%    - Build another kernel (separate from the STS) be the arbiter to round
%    robin to the AIE from the processor
%- Increase number of RC\_SAMPLES and PULSES
%    - This may be possible if we can not do ping-pong buffers but singular buffers
%    - Also should look into utilizing memory from neighboring tiles (not sure
%    if that is facilitated for you by the tools or you have to manually invoke
%    that)
%- Incorporating more ILP for further performance optimization.
%- Implement stripmap imaging mode
%- Utilizing FPGA/DSP
%- All RC samples don't need to be passed to all image reconstruction kernels
%because these kernels only need some subset of the range compressed samples.
%This was the intention for the rtp\_rc\_idx\_offset\_in RTP value


% NOTEEEEE!!!!! WHEN SHOWING THE PL STRIDE CONTROLLER AIE GRAPH, I NEED TO
% MENTION THAT I NEVER SCALED UP THE PL STRIDE CONTROLLER PASSED 1 BP CLUSTER
% BECAUSE I REALIZED THAT ALTHOUGH IT COMPUTED THE SIMILAR RESULTS AS THE
% MAIN/HOST_STRIDE BRANCHES, IT WAS ACTUALLY SLOWER, SO DEVELOPMENT ON IT WAS
% HALTED FOR NOW...OR RATHER...THIS IS WHERE DEVELOPMENT WAS HALTED AND WE RAN
% OUT OF MONEY.
