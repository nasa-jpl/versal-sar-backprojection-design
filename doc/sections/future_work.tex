- More AIE kernels for processing:
    - Pixel target generation inside AIE kernels
    - Pixel target generation from PL to AIE
    - Have the STS kernel take the pixels from the host and round robin them to
    the AIE
    - Build another kernel (separate from the STS) be the arbiter to round
    robin to the AIE from the processor
- Increase number of RC\_SAMPLES and PULSES
    - This may be possible if we can not do ping-pong buffers but singular buffers
    - Also should look into utilizing memory from neighboring tiles (not sure
    if that is facilitated for you by the tools or you have to manually invoke
    that)
- Incorporating more ILP for further performance optimization.
- Implement stripmap imaging mode
- Utilizing FPGA/DSP
- All RC samples don't need to be passed to all image reconstruction kernels
because these kernels only need some subset of the range compressed samples.
This was the intention for the rtp\_rc\_idx\_offset\_in RTP value
